NAME
     3) cal, ncal — displays a calendar and the date of Easter



DESCRIPTION
     
The cal utility displays a simple calendar in traditional format and ncal offers an alternative layout, more options and the date of Easter.  The new format
     is a little cramped but it makes a year fit on a 25x80 terminal.  If arguments are not specified, the current month is displayed.

     The options are as follows:

     -h      Turns off highlighting of today.

     -J      Display Julian Calendar, if combined with the -o option, display date of Orthodox Easter according to the Julian Calendar.

     -e      Display date of Easter (for western churches).

     -j      Display Julian days (days one-based, numbered from January 1).

     -m month
             Display the specified month.  If month is specified as a decimal number, appending ‘f’ or ‘p’ displays the same month of the following or previous
             year respectively.

     -o      Display date of Orthodox Easter (Greek and Russian Orthodox Churches).

     -p      Print the country codes and switching days from Julian to Gregorian Calendar as they are assumed by ncal.  The country code as determined from the
             local environment is marked with an asterisk.

     -s country_code
             Assume the switch from Julian to Gregorian Calendar at the date associated with the country_code.  If not specified, ncal tries to guess the switch
             date from the local environment or falls back to September 2, 1752.  This was when Great Britain and her colonies switched to the Gregorian Calendar.

     -w      Print the number of the week below each week column.

     -y      Display a calendar for the specified year. This option is implied when a year but no month are specified on the command line.


NAME
     4)  bc - An arbitrary precision calculator language

SYNTAX
       bc [ -hlwsqv ] [long-options] [  file ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       bc  is  a  language  that supports arbitrary precision numbers with interactive execution of statements.  There are some similarities in the syntax to the C
       programming language.  A standard math library is available by command line option.  If requested, the math library is defined before processing any  files.
       bc  starts  by  processing  code  from all the files listed on the command line in the order listed.  After all files have been processed, bc reads from the
       standard input.  All code is executed as it is read.  (If a file contains a command to halt the processor, bc will never read from the standard input.)

       This version of bc contains several extensions beyond traditional bc implementations and the POSIX draft standard.  Command line  options  can  cause  these
       extensions to print a warning or to be rejected.  This document describes the language accepted by this processor.  Extensions will be identified as such.

   OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print the usage and exit.

       -i, --interactive
              Force interactive mode.

       -l, --mathlib
              Define the standard math library.

       -w, --warn
              Give warnings for extensions to POSIX bc.

       -s, --standard
              Process exactly the POSIX bc language.

       -q, --quiet
              Do not print the normal GNU bc welcome.

       -v, --version
              Print the version number and copyright and quit.


NAME
     5)  date - print or set the system date and time

SYNOPSIS
       date [OPTION]... [+FORMAT]
       date [-u|--utc|--universal] [MMDDhhmm[[CC]YY][.ss]]

DESCRIPTION
       Display the current time in the given FORMAT, or set the system date.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -d, --date=STRING
              display time described by STRING, not 'now'

       --debug
              annotate the parsed date, and warn about questionable usage to stderr

       -f, --file=DATEFILE
              like --date; once for each line of DATEFILE

       -I[FMT], --iso-8601[=FMT]
              output  date/time  in ISO 8601 format.  FMT='date' for date only (the default), 'hours', 'minutes', 'seconds', or 'ns' for date and time to the indi‐
              cated precision.  Example: 2006-08-14T02:34:56-06:00

       -R, --rfc-2822
              output date and time in RFC 2822 format.  Example: Mon, 14 Aug 2006 02:34:56 -0600


       -r, --reference=FILE
              display the last modification time of FILE

       -s, --set=STRING
              set time described by STRING

       -u, --utc, --universal
              print or set Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)

 --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit


NAME
    6)   time - run programs and summarize system resource usage


DESCRIPTION
       time run the program COMMAND with any given arguments ARG....  When COMMAND finishes, time displays information about resources used by COMMAND (on the
       standard error output, by default).  If COMMAND exits with non-zero status, time displays a warning message and the exit status.

       time determines which information to display about the resources used by the COMMAND from the string FORMAT.  If no format is specified on the command line,
       but the TIME environment variable is set, its value is used as the format.  Otherwise, a default format built into time is used.

       Options to time must appear on the command line before COMMAND.  Anything on the command line after COMMAND is passed as arguments to COMMAND.

OPTIONS
       -o FILE, --output=FILE
              Write the resource use statistics to FILE instead of to the standard error stream.  By default, this overwrites the file, destroying the file's
              previous contents.  This option is useful for collecting information on interactive programs and programs that produce output on the standard error
              stream.

       -a, --append
              Append the resource use information to the output file instead of overwriting it.  This option is only useful with the `-o' or `--output' option.

       -f FORMAT, --format FORMAT
              Use FORMAT as the format string that controls the output of time.  See the below more information.

       --help Print a summary of the command line options and exit.

       -p, --portability
              Use the following format string, for conformance with POSIX standard 1003.2:
                        real %e
                        user %U
                        sys %S

       -v, --verbose
              Use the built-in verbose format, which displays each available piece of information on the program's resource use on its own line, with an English
              description of its meaning.

 --quiet
              Do not report the status of the program even if it is different from zero.

       -V, --version
              Print the version number of time and exit.
