Develop a basic Shell

Basic lifetime of a shell

1.Initialize: In this step, a typical shell would read and execute its configuration files. These change aspects of the shellâ€™s behavior.
2.Interpret: Next, the shell reads commands from stdin (which could be interactive, or a file) and executes them.
3.Terminate: After its commands are executed, the shell executes any shutdown commands, frees up any memory, and terminates.


Simple way to handle commands 

1.Read: Read the command from standard input.
2.Parse: Separate the command string into a program and arguments.
3.Execute: Run the parsed command.
